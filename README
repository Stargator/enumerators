Enumerators: Random Access Enumerations of Dart Datatypes

For license information, please see LICENSE.

Enumerators is a library which allows for randomized or exhaustive testing
of Dart functions by providing random access enumerations of Dart datatypes. It
is heavily inspired by Jonas Dureg√•rd's testing-feat.

Put simply, it allows to test things like reverse(reverse(list)) == list by
picking, say, 100 random lists of booleans for list (quickcheck style), or by
enumerating all the lists of booleans up to a certain depth (smallcheck style).
It is however up to the user to provide the glorified while loops that
constitute the "quickcheck" and "smallcheck" functions of these libraries.

Have a look at the example/ directory for (commented) examples of simple and
advanced usage of the library.
